# What is Super Tic Tac Toe?

Super Tic Tac Toe is an extended version of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. In the traditional version, players aim to get three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a 3x3 grid. Super Tic Tac Toe takes this concept to a larger scale.

## Rules

In Super Tic Tac Toe, the game is played on a 9x9 grid, which is composed of nine individual 3x3 grids. Each of these smaller grids functions as a regular Tic Tac Toe board. The twist is that instead of winning by getting three in a row in one of the smaller grids, players must win the smaller grids to claim the larger grid. The objective is to win three smaller grids in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the overall game.

When a player makes a move in one of the smaller grids, their opponent must make their next move in the corresponding grid of the larger board. This adds an extra layer of strategy, as players need to think not only about winning the smaller grids but also about positioning themselves to win the larger board.
